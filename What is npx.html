    <h1>What is npx?</h1><p>You may have heard of npm, but what about npx? </p><h2>What is npx</h2><p>npx is a executable that is bundled with npm@5.2.0 and above.</p><p>It makes running binaries from packages installed in your node projects much simpler!</p><p>To try npx out, just type npx {binaryName}. npx will start by checking your project’s local node_modules/.bin folder for the specified binaryName, and if it doesn’t find it there, it will move to your global installs.</p><p>If the binary isn’t found on your machine anywhere, it will install the latest version in a one off install, use it, then throw the install away! This way you don’t have to worry about polluting your global scopes with packages that you use once in a blue moon (like create-react-app for example).</p><p>Similar to one off scripts above, you can point npx to a remote javascript file via the url, and npx will download it and execute it for you.</p><p>For example:</p><p>npx <a href="https://gist.github.com/bambielli/8d7cb891423def24e643ac5be174bd03" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/bambielli/8d7cb891423def24e643ac5be174bd03</a></p><p>should log the secret is: npx rox to your console</p><p>Always be careful when executing remote files that you do not own… be sure to read through them to make sure there isn’t any malicious code in there.</p><h2>Use case for npx</h2><p>This week at work I was using the sequelize-cli package to automate the execution of migrations and seed data for a hackathon project.</p><p>The binary was installed locally to my project under node_modules/.bin/sequelize, and the readme for sequelize-cli instructed to execute the binary by typing that full path before each command.</p><p>My first instinct was to turn this into an npm script, which I did:</p><p>package.json</p><p>{  "scripts": {    "db:migrate" 'node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate'  }}</p><p>I could run this script by typing npm run db:migrate, which is already pretty easy.</p><p>npx made life even easier, though: when I wanted to seed my database, I just ran npx sequelize db:seed from my command line, without needing to create a new npm script for seeding. Easy as that! No more typing the full node_modules path to your project binaries, or bloating your package.json with npm scripts that are shortcuts for project binaries.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://bambielli.com/til/2018-10-06-npx/" target="_blank">https://bambielli.com/til/2018-10-06-npx/</a></p></body></html>
