# Node-TILify

Welcome to Node-TILify. An open source CLI software that helps you convert a text file or a directory of text file(s) into html file(s) blazingly fast üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üí® ‚ö°Ô∏è. The name of the project was chosen to showcase which language/framework was used to build this tool -- _`Node`.js_, what the tool is all about -- _`TIL` - Today I Learned_, & the value that it adds to your workflow -- _Ampl`ify`ing Knowledge_.

# How to use / Installation

Make sure [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is installed on your system. Also, make sure you have latest [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your computer. 

To install this program, first clone the repository by running: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdthaker/Node-TILify.git
```

To make sure node & npm are installed on your system, run: 
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You can now run the program from the cloned repository's terminal to see how to use this tool:
```bash
node src/index.js -h
```

_Optional_ - If you'd like to spin up a node server, open a terminal inside of the cloned repository, and install the node dependencies & spin up the server by running:
```bash
npm install
npm run start
``` 

# Features

- Pass in a txt file and it'll generate an html file.
- Pass in a directory and it'll search through all the txt files in that directory and generate html files which are stored in `./til` directory.
- Every paragraph is enclosed with `<p>` tag.
- Every hyperlink starting with `https://` or `http://` is enclosed with `<a>` tag.
- Every line that ends in ^ is enclosed in `<h2>` tag.
- <ins>_Optional Feature #1_</ins>: If the first line of the text has 2 spaces after it, a `<title>` tag is added to the `<head>` and a `<h1>` tag is added at the beginning of `<body>`.
- <ins>_Optional Feature #5_</ins>: Stylesheet is added to every html file to improve the looks of it.
- Passing `-h` or `--help` command prints help menu.
- Passing `-v` or `--version` command prints version and name of the tool.
- <ins>_Optional Feature #2_</ins>: Passing `-o` or `--output` command followed by an output directory path, stores all the generated HTML files to that directory. If no directory exists, it'll create one. It overwrites the content of the files that match with the input file or directory of files and creates a new file if it doesn't exist in the output directory.
- Name of the generated html file is the same as name of txt file.
